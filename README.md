# CrystalClickCamera
My practice camera app.

This app was initially developed as a testing space for camera functionality halfway through the course, but developed into its own app.  Crystal Click Camera lets you take a photo or choose a photo from your library, upon which you can scribble.  You can also choose to make a blank scribble, if you want.  You can save your finished image to your phone.
