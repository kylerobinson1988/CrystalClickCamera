#Crystal Click Camera

This is my own personal project where you take a picture (or choose one from the libary) using UIImagePicker.  It's written in Swift.

After you take a picture, you can scribble on it and save the result.  You can adjust the stroke to one of several colors and also adjust line thickness.
